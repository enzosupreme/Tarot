This device displays a random card out of the 78 Tarot cards in the deck. This project was a gift for my sister, Tiara. I needed to come up with a Birthday gift and the only thing i could think to make involved Tarot cards after hearing her mention them during a game of D&D. I wired up a TFT display that has an sd card slot to a switch and  made an enclosure. I downloaded images of all 78 Tarot cards, resized them in photoshop and then converted them into bmps. After writing the code in Arduino and getting everything to work properly, I attatched 2 AA batters and a switch for power. I would have cleaned up the design a bit but kind of ran out of time.![PXL_20240528_205524857](https://github.com/enzosupreme/Tarot/assets/38119453/4f628e18-a164-4278-9e95-a043e9791c6f)
